Changelog:
V 0.1.0: "In the beginning...":

ADDED:
+Added four new races into the game: Human, Dwarf, Wraith, and Gnoll.
+Added four new artifacts: The Wooden Effigy, the Wraith Amulet, the Chains of Ares, and the Comm Relay
+New weapon enchantment added: Null adds a random chance to Silence a mob.
-New Debuff: The Decay debuff is the first try at a suggested idea of "permanent debuffs," which require certain events
in order to be removed. It is applied by Blue Wraiths, in order to discourage excess farming in the BOTD (though you'll
probably have so many potions of healing at this point that it won't matter too much). It will do a moderate amount of 
damage every ten turns. To remove the debuff, stand on a sungrass seed for a few turns.
-New Debuff: The Silence debuff makes a character unable to use any ranged weapons. It is affected by Ring of Elements. 
Goes away after a duration. Some other mobs may be affected in other ways by this debuff due to their nature.

TWEAKED: 
+Wands of Telekinesis will now cause any flying enemy they hit to lose the ability to fly for but a moment.
~**Scrolls that burn will now "detonate", in a similar manner to potions that shatter.** Some have exactly the expected effect.
Burning a Scroll of Regrowth is very not advised.
-Mystery Meat's debuffs have been changed due to people complaining that the old effects weren't "realistic enough."
-Dachhack's mystery meat will now apply all the same debuffs as regular mystery meat. (Though at a lower chance) 
//You think I'm putting all that work into it just for people to cook some goddamn crab meat? No, man, I'm putting 
it in so that people can cook some regular meat too.


ADDITIONAL:
~It's Blue. Da ba dee.
~Renamed the packaging to com.avmoga.dpixel
~Began behind-the-scenes work on implementing Gods, and a new quest(s).
+Updated the source code to 0.3.5, which entailed a significant amount of copying and pasting getLength() and getWidth(). Thanks, Dachhack.
~A bunch of other stuff that I've forgotten about but is definetely in there
